## Q1. Git/GitHub

**No handwritten homework reports are accepted for this course.** We
work with Git and GitHub. Efficient and abundant use of Git, e.g.,
frequent and well-documented commits, is an important criterion for
grading your homework.

1.  Apply for the [Student Developer
    Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) at GitHub using your UCLA
    email. You'll get GitHub Pro account for free (unlimited public and
    private repositories).

2.  Create a **private** repository `biostat-203b-2024-winter` and add
    `Hua-Zhou` and TA team (`Tomoki-Okuno` for Lec 1; `jonathanhori` and
    `jasenzhang1` for Lec 80) as your collaborators with write
    permission.

3.  Top directories of the repository should be `hw1`, `hw2`, ...
    Maintain two branches `main` and `develop`. The `develop` branch
    will be your main playground, the place where you develop solution
    (code) to homework problems and write up report. The `main` branch
    will be your presentation area. Submit your homework files (Quarto
    file `qmd`, `html` file converted by Quarto, all code and extra data
    sets to reproduce results) in the `main` branch.

4.  After each homework due date, course reader and instructor will
    check out your `main` branch for grading. Tag each of your homework
    submissions with tag names `hw1`, `hw2`, ... Tagging time will be
    used as your submission time. That means if you tag your `hw1`
    submission after deadline, penalty points will be deducted for late
    submission.

5.  After this course, you can make this repository public and use it to
    demonstrate your skill sets on job market.

**Answer:** I applied for the Student Developer Pack at GitHub using my
UCLA email. I created a private repository `biostat-203b-2024-winter`
and added Prof. `Hua-Zhou` and TA `Tomoki-Okuno` as my collaborators
with write permission. The top directories of the repository are `hw1`.
I maintain two branches `main` and `develop`. All code and extra data
sets to reproduce results are in the `main` branch. And I have read all
the instructions carefully.

## Q2. Data ethics training

This exercise (and later in this course) uses the [MIMIC-IV data
v2.2](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/2.2/), a freely accessible
critical care database developed by the MIT Lab for Computational
Physiology. Follow the instructions at
<https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/gettingstarted/> to (1) complete the CITI
`Data or Specimens Only Research` course and (2) obtain the PhysioNet
credential for using the MIMIC-IV data. Display the verification links
to your completion report and completion certificate here. **You must
complete Q2 before working on the remaining questions.** (Hint: The CITI
training takes a few hours and the PhysioNet credentialing takes a
couple days; do not leave it to the last minute.)

**Answer:**

I completed the CITI training on 1/18/2021. The completion report is
available at
[here](https://www.citiprogram.org/verify/?k6b4494ee-7938-4b63-920b-1da005d66727-60622234).
The completion certificate is available at
[here](https://www.citiprogram.org/verify/?w2edd6762-e466-4ba4-b34d-4928a65f485d-60622234).

I also obtained the PhysioNet credential for using the MIMIC-IV data.
Here is the screenshot of my PhysioNet credentialing.![screenshot of
Credentialing](./Credential.jpg)

## Q3. Linux Shell Commands

1.  Make the MIMIC v2.2 data available at location `~/mimic`.

```{bash}
#| eval: false
ls -l ~/mimic/
```

Refer to the documentation <https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/2.2/>
for details of data files. Please, do **not** put these data files into
Git; they are big. Do **not** copy them into your directory. Do **not**
decompress the gz data files. These create unnecessary big files and are
not big-data-friendly practices. Read from the data folder `~/mimic`
directly in following exercises.

Use Bash commands to answer following questions.

**Answer:**

I downloaded the MIMIC-IV v2.2 data to my local machine. I create a
symbolic link to the original directory to MIMIC-IV v2.2 data under the
path `~/mimic` in my command panel.

```{bash}
#| eval: false  
ln -s /Users/jacenai/Desktop/BIOSTAT_203B/mimic-iv-2.2/  ~/mimic
```

Now, the data files are available at `~/mimic`. The data files are not
put into Git. The data files are not copied into my directory. The gz
data files are not decompressed.

```{bash}
ls -l ~/mimic/
```

2.  Display the contents in the folders `hosp` and `icu` using Bash
    command `ls -l`. Why are these data files distributed as `.csv.gz`
    files instead of `.csv` (comma separated values) files? Read the
    page <https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/> to understand what's in each
    folder.

**Answer:** This is the content of the folder `hosp`:

```{bash}
ls -l ~/mimic/hosp
```

This is the content of the folder `icu`:

```{bash}
ls -l ~/mimic/icu
```

The reason for why these data files are distributed as `.csv.gz` files
instead of `.csv` files is: the `.csv.gz` indicates that the file is
compressed using gzip compression. It used compressed files rather than
the `.csv` files is because the data set contains comprehensive
information for each patient while they were in the hospital, so it
would need huge storage space if not compressed. Compression reduces the
file size, making it quicker to download and transfer and requiring less
bandwidth when downloading, which can be important for users with
limited internet bandwidth.

3.  Briefly describe what Bash commands `zcat`, `zless`, `zmore`, and
    `zgrep` do.

**Answer:**

-   `zcat` is used to display the content of one or more compressed
    files on the standard output.

-   `zless` is used to view the contents of a compressed file one page
    at a time. It provides a convenient way to scroll through the
    contents of a compressed file.

-   `zmore` is similar to `zless` and serves as a pager for compressed
    files and is used to view the contents of a compressed file one page
    at a time. It primarily supports forward navigation through the
    content.

-   `zgrep` is used to search for a pattern within one or more
    compressed files.

4.  (Looping in Bash) What's the output of the following bash script?

```{bash}
#| eval: false
for datafile in ~/mimic/hosp/{a,l,pa}*.gz
do
  ls -l $datafile
done
```

Display the number of lines in each data file using a similar loop.
(Hint: combine linux commands `zcat <` and `wc -l`.)

**Answer:**

Display the number of lines in each data file using a similar loop:

```{bash}
for datafile in ~/mimic/hosp/{a,l,pa}*.gz
do
  echo "Number of lines in $datafile: $(zcat < $datafile | wc -l)"
done
```

5.  Display the first few lines of `admissions.csv.gz`. How many rows
    are in this data file? How many unique patients (identified by
    `subject_id`) are in this data file? Do they match the number of
    patients listed in the `patients.csv.gz` file? (Hint: combine Linux
    commands `zcat <`, `head`/`tail`, `awk`, `sort`, `uniq`, `wc`, and
    so on.)

**Answer:**

Display the first few lines of admissions.csv.gz

```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/admissions.csv.gz | head -10
```

```{bash}
#Count the number of rows in admissions.csv.gz
row_count=$(zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/admissions.csv.gz | wc -l)
echo "Number of rows in admissions.csv.gz: $row_count"
```

```{bash}
#Count the number of unique patients (identified by subject_id) in admissions.csv.gz:
subject_count=$(zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/admissions.csv.gz | tail -n +2 | awk -F ',' '{print $1}' | sort -u | wc -l)
echo "Number of unique patients in admissions.csv.gz (excluding header): $subject_count"
```

```{bash}
#Count the number of unique patients (identified by subject_id) in patients.csv.gz:
subject_count=$(zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/patients.csv.gz | tail -n +2 | awk -F ',' '{print $1}' | sort -u | wc -l)
echo "Number of unique patients in patients.csv.gz (excluding header): $subject_count"
```

Therefore, the number of patients listed in the `patients.csv.gz` file
doesn't match the number of unique patients in the `admissions.csv.gz`
file.

6.  What are the possible values taken by each of the variable
    `admission_type`, `admission_location`, `insurance`, and
    `ethnicity`? Also report the count for each unique value of these
    variables. (Hint: combine Linux commands `zcat`, `head`/`tail`,
    `awk`, `uniq -c`, `wc`, and so on; skip the header line.)

**Answer:**

First, getting to know the variables' names.

```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/admissions.csv.gz | head -n 1
```

Get possible values taken by the variable `admission_type` and its count

```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/admissions.csv.gz | awk -F',' 'NR > 1 {print $6}' | sort | uniq -c
```

Get possible values taken by the variable `admission_location` and its
count

```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/admissions.csv.gz | awk -F',' 'NR > 1 {print $8}' | sort | uniq -c
```

Get possible values taken by the variable `insurance` and its count

```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/admissions.csv.gz | awk -F',' 'NR > 1 {print $10}' | sort | uniq -c
```

Get possible values taken by the variable `race`/`ethnicity` and its
count

```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/admissions.csv.gz | awk -F',' 'NR > 1 {print $13}' | sort | uniq -c
```

7.  *To compress, or not to compress. That's the question.* Let's focus
    on the big data file `labevents.csv.gz`. Compare compressed gz file
    size to the uncompressed file size. Compare the run times of
    `zcat < ~/mimic/labevents.csv.gz | wc -l` versus
    `wc -l labevents.csv`. Discuss the trade off between storage and
    speed for big data files. (Hint:
    `gzip -dk < FILENAME.gz > ./FILENAME`. Remember to delete the large
    `labevents.csv` file after the exercise.)

**Answer:**

First, **comparing the file sizes:** The compressed file size is 1.8G
and the uncompressed file size is 13G. The uncompressed file size is
more than 7 times larger than the compressed file size.

```{bash}
#compressed file size
ls -lh ~/mimic/hosp/labevents.csv.gz

#decompress the file 
gzip -dk < ~/mimic/hosp/labevents.csv.gz > ~/mimic/hosp/labevents.csv

#uncompressed file size
ls -lh ~/mimic/hosp/labevents.csv

```

Then, **comparing the run times:** From the output below, in general,
the run time of `zcat` on the compressed file is more than the run time
of `wc` on the uncompressed file.

```{bash}
#run time of zcat on the compressed file
time zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/labevents.csv.gz | wc -l

#run time of wc on the uncompressed file
time wc -l ~/mimic/hosp/labevents.csv

```

**Trade-off between storage and speed:** compressed files save storage
space but may require additional time for decompression during access.
Uncompressed files provide faster access but consume more storage space.
If storage space is a critical concern and access speed can be
tolerated, compression is beneficial. However, if rapid access is
crucial and storage space is not a limiting factor, using uncompressed
files might be preferred.

```{bash}
# remove the large uncompressed file
rm ~/mimic/hosp/labevents.csv
```

## Q4. Who's popular in Price and Prejudice

1.  You and your friend just have finished reading *Pride and Prejudice*
    by Jane Austen. Among the four main characters in the book,
    Elizabeth, Jane, Lydia, and Darcy, your friend thinks that Darcy was
    the most mentioned. You, however, are certain it was Elizabeth.
    Obtain the full text of the novel from
    <http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/42671/pg42671.txt> and save to
    your local folder.

```{bash}
#| eval: false
wget -nc http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/42671/pg42671.txt
```

Explain what `wget -nc` does. Do **not** put this text file
`pg42671.txt` in Git. Complete the following loop to tabulate the number
of times each of the four characters is mentioned using Linux commands.

```{bash}
#| eval: false
wget -nc http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/42671/pg42671.txt
for char in Elizabeth Jane Lydia Darcy
do
  echo $char:
  # some bash commands here
done
```

**Answer:**

**Explanation**: The `wget` command with the option `-nc` is used to
download a file from the web URL, but it will not overwrite an existing
file. Specifically, `wget` is the command for retrieving files from the
web; `-nc` stands for `no-clobber`. It ensures that `wget` won't
overwrite existing files. If the file already exists locally, `wget`
will not download it again.

```{bash}
wget -nc http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/42671/pg42671.txt
for char in Elizabeth Jane Lydia Darcy
do
  echo "$char:"
  grep -o -i "$char" pg42671.txt | wc -l
done
```

The number of times each of the four characters is: Elizabeth: 634 Jane:
293 Lydia: 171 Darcy: 418.

2.  What's the difference between the following two commands?

```{bash}
#| eval: false
echo 'hello, world' > test1.txt
```

and

```{bash}
#| eval: false
echo 'hello, world' >> test2.txt
```

**Answer:**

In the first command `echo 'hello, world' > test1.txt`, `>` is used for
output redirection and creates or overwrites the content of the
specified file (`test1.txt`) with the output of the `echo` command.
While for the second command `echo 'hello, world' >> test2.txt`, `>>` is
also used for output redirection but appends the output of the `echo`
command to the end of the specified file (`test2.txt`). In summary, `>`
overwrites the file with new content, while `>>` appends the content to
the end of the file.

3.  Using your favorite text editor (e.g., `vi`), type the following and
    save the file as `middle.sh`:

```{bash eval=FALSE}
#!/bin/sh
# Select lines from the middle of a file.
# Usage: bash middle.sh filename end_line num_lines
head -n "$2" "$1" | tail -n "$3"
```

Using `chmod` to make the file executable by the owner, and run

```{bash}
#| eval: false
./middle.sh pg42671.txt 20 5
```

Explain the output. Explain the meaning of `"$1"`, `"$2"`, and `"$3"` in
this shell script. Why do we need the first line of the shell script?

**Answer:**

First, I used vi and type the command, and save the file as `middle.sh`

```{bash}
echo '#!/bin/sh' > middle.sh
echo '# Select lines from the middle of a file.' >> middle.sh
echo '# Usage: bash middle.sh filename end_line num_lines' >> middle.sh
echo 'head -n "$2" "$1" | tail -n "$3"' >> middle.sh
```

Then, I used `chmod` to make the file executable by the owner and run
the command

```{bash}
#make the middle.sh script executable 
chmod a+x middle.sh
./middle.sh pg42671.txt 20 5

```

**Output Explanation**: The output will be the 5 lines from the middle
of the file `pg42671.txt`, starting from line 16 and ending at line 20.
`pg42671.txt` specifies the file need to read, **`20`** means that it
extracts the first 20 lines from the file **`pg42671.txt`**, and **`5`**
means that it extracts the last 5 lines from the output received from
that 20 lines.

**Explanation of `$1`, `$2`, and `$3`**:

Since the following code gives the same output as the command
`head -20 pg42671.txt | tail -5`

```{bash}
head -20 pg42671.txt | tail -5
```

I can conclude that:

`$1`: this is the first argument (**`$1`**) passed to the script. It
represents the filename of the file. In this case, it's assumed to be a
file named **`pg42671.txt`**.

`$2`: this is the second argument (**`$2`**) passed to the script. It
represents the end line number from which to start selecting lines. In
this case, it's **`20`**, meaning that it extracts the first 20 lines
from the file **`pg42671.txt`**.

`$3`: this is the third argument (**`$3`**) passed to the script. It
represents the number of lines to select from the middle. In this case,
it's **`5`**, meaning that it extracts the last 5 lines from the output
received from the **`head`** command. The result is then printed to the
standard output.

**Why do we need the first line of the shell script?** / Purpose of
(`#!/bin/sh`):

(`#!/bin/sh`) is essential for indicating which shell interpreter should
be used to execute the script. In this case, it specifies /bin/sh, which
is a common location for the Bourne shell. Without this line, the script
might be interpreted by a different shell, and its behavior could vary.

## Q5. More fun with Linux

Try following commands in Bash and interpret the results: `cal`,
`cal 2024`, `cal 9 1752` (anything unusual?), `date`, `hostname`,
`arch`, `uname -a`, `uptime`, `who am i`, `who`, `w`, `id`,
`last | head`, `echo {con,pre}{sent,fer}{s,ed}`, `time sleep 5`,
`history | tail`.

**Answer:**

```{bash}
cal
```

`cal`: displays the current month's calendar.

```{bash}
cal 2024
```

`cal 2024`: displays the calendar for the year 2024.

```{bash}
cal 9 1752
```

`cal 9 1752`: displays the calendar for September 1752. The calendar is
unusual from the modern calendar because the switch from the Julian to
the Gregorian calendar happened in September 1752, so the calendar
missed 11 days form September 3 to September 13.

```{bash}
date
```

`date`: Prints the current date and time.

```{bash}
hostname
```

`hostname`: prints the hostname of the server that I'm currently logged
into.

```{bash}
arch
```

`arch` command in Linux is used to display the architecture of the
current system. It provides information about the instruction set
architecture of the processor, helping users identify whether it's a
32-bit or 64-bit system. In my case, my system is running on an arm64
architecture, and it means that my processor supports 64-bit
instructions.

```{bash}
uname -a
```

`uname -a` command in Linux is used to display detailed information
about the system's kernel and hardware. It provides a comprehensive set
of details about the system, including the kernel name, network node
hostname, kernel release, kernel version, machine hardware name,
processor type, hardware platform, and the operating system. In my case,
the kernel name is "Darwin," and the network node hostname is
"s-169-232-81-195.resnet.ucla.edu." The kernel release, version 22.4.0,
indicates the specific version of the Darwin kernel. The timestamp "Mon
Mar 6 21:01:02 PST 2023" denotes when the kernel was built.

```{bash}
uptime
```

`uptime` command in Linux is used to display the current time, how long
the system has been running, and information about the system's load
averages. It provides a quick overview of the system's status and
activity.

```{bash}
who am i
```

`who am i` command in Linux is used to display information about the
current user who is logged into the system. It provides details such as
the username and the time the user logged in. In my case, the username
is "jacenai," and the time the user logged in is "Jan 24 10:11"

```{bash}
who
```

`who` command displays information about currently logged-in users. It
provides details such as the username, terminal, login time

```{bash}
w
```

`w` command displays information about the currently logged-in users and
their activities. It provides a summary of user-related information,
including details about each user's login session, the time they've been
idle, and the commands they are currently running.

```{bash}
id
```

`id` command displays information about the user and group identities
(ID) associated with the current user or a specified username.

```{bash}
last | head
```

`last` command in Linux is used to display information about previously
logged-in users, including their login and logout times. When combined
with the `head` command, it limits the output to the specified 10 newest
lines.

```{bash}
echo {con,pre}{sent,fer}{s,ed}
```

`echo {con,pre}{sent,fer}{s,ed}` allows me to generate strings by
specifying patterns enclosed in curly braces {}. The comma-separated
values within the braces represent options, and this command generates
all possible combinations of those options. In this case, the command
generates the following strings: "consents," "conferred," "consented,"
"confers," "presents," "presented," "prefers," and "preferred."

```{bash}
time sleep 5
```

`time` command in Linux is used to measure the execution time of a given
command or script, and `sleep 5` pauses the shell for a duration of five
seconds. When combined, the command measures the execution time of the
`sleep 5` command.

```{bash}
history | tail
```

`history` command in Linux is used to display the last executed
commands. When combined with the `tail` command, it limits the output to
the specified 10 newest lines. In my case, since each command is
executed seperately in the terminal, the output of the `history` command
is empty. But I input expected output if the commands operate in line.

```{bash}
# 100  arch
# 101  uname -a
# 102  uptime
# 103  who am i
# 104  who
# 105  w
# 106  id
# 107  last | head
# 108  time sleep 5
# 109  history | tail
```

## Q6. Book

1.  Git clone the repository
    <https://github.com/christophergandrud/Rep-Res-Book> for the book
    *Reproducible Research with R and RStudio* to your local machine.

2.  Open the project by clicking `rep-res-3rd-edition.Rproj` and compile
    the book by clicking `Build Book` in the `Build` panel of RStudio.
    (Hint: I was able to build `git_book` and `epub_book` but not
    `pdf_book`.)

The point of this exercise is (1) to get the book for free and (2) to
see an example how a complicated project such as a book can be organized
in a reproducible way.

For grading purpose, include a screenshot of Section 4.1.5 of the book
here.

**Answer:** First, I used fork to create a copy of the repository on
github. Then, I used the following command to clone the repository to my
local machine.

```{bash}
#git clone git@github.com:jacenai/Rep-Res-Book.git git@github.com:jacenai/biostat-203b-2024-winter.git
```

Next, I opened the project by clicking `rep-res-3rd-edition.Rproj` and
compiled the book by clicking `Build Book` in the `Build` panel of
RStudio, during which I downloaded a few R packages. Finally, I was able
to build `git_book`. The following screenshot shows the output of
Section 4.1.5 of the book. ![screenshot of Section
4.1.5](./Section4.1.5.png)

In this exercise, we use tidyverse (ggplot2, dplyr, etc) to explore the [MIMIC-IV](https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/) data introduced in [homework 1](https://ucla-biostat-203b.github.io/2024winter/hw/hw1/hw1.html) and to build a cohort of ICU stays.

## Q1. Visualizing patient trajectory

Visualizing a patient's encounters in a health care system is a common task in clinical data analysis. In this question, we will visualize a patient's ADT (admission-discharge-transfer) history and ICU vitals in the MIMIC-IV data.

### Q1.1 ADT history

A patient's ADT history records the time of admission, discharge, and transfer in the hospital. This figure shows the ADT history of the patient with `subject_id` 10001217 in the MIMIC-IV data. The x-axis is the calendar time, and the y-axis is the type of event (ADT, lab, procedure). The color of the line segment represents the care unit. The size of the line segment represents whether the care unit is an ICU/CCU. The crosses represent lab events, and the shape of the dots represents the type of procedure. The title of the figure shows the patient's demographic information and the subtitle shows top 3 diagnoses.

![](10001217_adt.png) Do a similar visualization for the patient with `subject_id` 10013310 using ggplot.

Hint: We need to pull information from data files `patients.csv.gz`, `admissions.csv.gz`, `transfers.csv.gz`, `labevents.csv.gz`, `procedures_icd.csv.gz`, `diagnoses_icd.csv.gz`, `d_icd_procedures.csv.gz`, and `d_icd_diagnoses.csv.gz`. For the big file `labevents.csv.gz`, use the Parquet format you generated in Homework 2. For reproducibility, make the Parquet folder `labevents_pq` available at the current working directory `hw3`, for example, by a symbolic link. Make your code reproducible.

**Answer**

**Step I**: getting the demographic information

\(1\) get to know the structure of `patients.csv.gz` and `admissions.csv.gz` by `zcat` and `head`.

```{bash}
#| eval: false
zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/patients.csv.gz | head
zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/admissions.csv.gz | head
```

\(2\) read the `patients.csv.gz` and `admissions.csv.gz` by `read_csv` and `filter` the patient with `subject_id` 10013310. And then get the demographic information of the patient.

```{r}
#| eval: true
race <- read_csv("~/mimic/hosp/admissions.csv.gz") %>%
  filter(subject_id == 10013310) %>%
  distinct(race)

demographics <- read_csv("~/mimic/hosp/patients.csv.gz") %>%
  filter(subject_id == 10013310) %>%
  mutate(race = tolower(race$race))  # Lower case the race column
```

**Step II**: getting the top 3 diagnoses of the patient

\(1\) get to know the structure of `diagnoses_icd.csv.gz` and `d_icd_diagnoses.csv.gz` by `zcat` and `head`.

```{bash}
#| eval: false
zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/diagnoses_icd.csv.gz | head
zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/d_icd_diagnoses.csv.gz | head
```

\(2\) read the `diagnoses_icd.csv.gz` and `d_icd_diagnoses.csv.gz` by `read_csv` and `filter` the patient with `subject_id` 10013310. Combine the two tables by `left_join`. Here I found that there are several diagnoses for the patient in each patient hospitalization. So, I count the frequency of all diagnosis and select the top 3 diagnoses.

```{r}
#| eval: true
top_3_diagnoses <- read_csv("~/mimic/hosp/diagnoses_icd.csv.gz") %>%
  filter(subject_id == 10013310) %>%
  left_join(read_csv("~/mimic/hosp/d_icd_diagnoses.csv.gz"), 
            by = c("icd_code" = "icd_code", 
                   "icd_version" = "icd_version")) %>%
  # Select the top 3 diagnoses
  group_by(long_title) %>%
  summarise(freq = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(freq)) %>%
  slice(1:3)
```

**Step III**: getting the ADT history of the patient

\(1\) get to know the structure of `diagnoses_icd.csv.gz` by `zcat` and `head`.

```{bash}
#| eval: false
zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/transfers.csv.gz | head
```

\(2\) read the `transfers.csv.gz` by `read_csv` and `filter` the patient with `subject_id` 10013310. And then get the ADT history of the patient. Also, I add a new column `segment_thickness` to represent the size of the line segment for the convenience of plotting.

```{r}
#| eval: true
ADT <- read_csv("~/mimic/hosp/transfers.csv.gz") %>%
  filter(subject_id == 10013310) %>%
  filter(!is.na(careunit)) %>%
  mutate(segment_thickness = if_else(str_detect(careunit, "Care Unit"), 10, 8))
```

**Step IV**: getting the lab events of the patient from `labevents.parquet` with `subject_id` 10013310 by `arrow::open_dataset`. (1) get to know the structure of `labevents.parquet` by `zcat` and `head`.

```{bash}
#| eval: false
zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/labevents.csv.gz | head
```

\(2\) decompressing the `labevents.csv.gz file`.

```{r}
#| eval: false
system("gzip -d -k ~/mimic/hosp/labevents.csv.gz")
```

\(3\) re-writing the csv file `labevents.csv` in the binary Parquet format.

```{r}
#| eval: false
# Define the file paths
file_path <- "~/mimic/hosp/labevents.csv"
parquet_file_path <- "~/mimic/hosp/labevents.parquet"

# Rewrite the CSV file in Parquet format    
arrow::write_dataset(arrow::open_dataset(file_path, format = "csv"), 
                     parquet_file_path, format = "parquet")
```

Also, I create a symbolic link for the original directory to the Parquet file `labevents.parquet` under the path under the folder `./labevents_pq` available at the current working directory `hw3` for reproducibility.

```{bash}
#| eval: true  
ln -s ~/mimic/hosp/labevents.parquet/  ./labevents_pq
```

\(4\) Reading the `labevents.parquet` file using the `arrow::open_dataset`. The information I need is the `subject_id` and `charttime` columns. So, I use the `dplyr::select` function to select these two columns and the `dplyr::filter` function to filter the `subject_id` 10013310. Also, there are duplicated `charttime` values because several lab events can happen at the same time, so I use the `dplyr::distinct` function to keep the unique `charttime` values.

```{r}
#| eval: true
labevents <- arrow::open_dataset('./labevents_pq', format = "parquet") %>%
  dplyr::select(subject_id, charttime) %>%
  dplyr::filter(subject_id == 10013310) %>%
  dplyr::distinct(subject_id, charttime) %>%
  collect()
```

**Step V**: getting the procedure events of the patient.

\(1\) get to know the structure of `procedures_icd.csv.gz` and `d_icd_procedures.csv.gz` by `zcat` and `head`.

```{bash}
#| eval: false
zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/procedures_icd.csv.gz | head
zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/d_icd_procedures.csv.gz | head
```

\(2\) read the `procedures_icd.csv.gz` and `d_icd_procedures.csv.gz` by `read_csv` and `filter` the patient with `subject_id` 10013310. Combine the two tables by `left_join`.

```{r}
#| eval: true
procedures <- read_csv("~/mimic/hosp/procedures_icd.csv.gz") %>%
  filter(subject_id == 10013310) %>%
  left_join(read_csv("~/mimic/hosp/d_icd_procedures.csv.gz"), 
            by = c("icd_code" = "icd_code", 
                   "icd_version" = "icd_version"))
```

**Step VI**: getting the plot by `ggplot2`.

I use the `ggplot` function to create a new plot. I use the `scale_x_datetime` function to specify the x axis limits, the `scale_y_discrete` function to specify the y axis with 3 levels, the `geom_point` function to add procedure events, the `scale_shape_manual` function to manually set the number of shapes according to the number of titles. Also, I use the `geom_segment` function to add ADT history, the `geom_point` function to add lab events, and the `geom_text` function to add diagnosis events. Finally, I use the `theme` function to set the theme of the plot.

```{r}
#| eval: true
ADT_history <- ggplot() +
  
  # Specify x axis limits
  scale_x_datetime(name = "Calendar Time", 
                   # minus 1 day from the minimum intime 
                   # to display all the data
                   limits = c(min(ADT$intime) - days(1), 
                              max(ADT$outtime))) +
  
  # Specify y axis with 3 levels
  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, 
                   limits = c("Procedure", "Lab", "ADT")) + 
  
  # Add procedure events
  geom_point(data = procedures, 
             aes(x = as.POSIXct(chartdate), 
                 y = "Procedure", 
                 # Get shorter title using regex
                 shape = sub(",.*", "", long_title)),
             size = 3) + 
  
  # Manually set the number of shapes according to the number of titles
  scale_shape_manual(values = c(1:n_distinct(procedures$long_title))) +
  
  # Add lab events
  geom_point(data = labevents, 
             aes(x = charttime, y = "Lab"), 
             shape = 3, size = 2) +
  
  # Add ADT events
  geom_segment(data = ADT, 
               aes(x = intime, 
                   xend = outtime, 
                   y = "ADT", 
                   yend = "ADT", 
                   color = careunit, 
                   size = segment_thickness)) +
  
  # Set legend position and arrangement
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", 
        legend.box = "vertical", 
        legend.key.size = unit(0, "pt"),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 7)) +
  
  # Set legend titles and arrangement
  guides(color = guide_legend(title = "Care Unit", 
                              ncol = 3,
                              keywidth = 1),
         shape = guide_legend(title = "Procedure", 
                              ncol = 2),
         # Remove legend for ADT
         size = FALSE) +
  
  # Add patient information as title and subtitle
  labs(title = paste("Patient", demographics$subject_id[1], ", ",
                     demographics$gender[1], ", ",
                     demographics$anchor_age[1], "years old, ",
                     demographics$race[1]),
       subtitle = paste(top_3_diagnoses$long_title[1],
                        top_3_diagnoses$long_title[2],
                        top_3_diagnoses$long_title[3],
                        sep = "\n"))
  
# Print the plot
print(ADT_history)
```

### Q1.2 ICU stays

ICU stays are a subset of ADT history. This figure shows the vitals of the patient `10001217` during ICU stays. The x-axis is the calendar time, and the y-axis is the value of the vital. The color of the line represents the type of vital. The facet grid shows the abbreviation of the vital and the stay ID.

![](10001217_icu.png)

Do a similar visualization for the patient `10013310`.

**Answer**

\(1\) get to know the structure of `chartevents.csv.gz` and `d_items.csv.gz` by `zcat` and `head`.

```{bash}
#| eval: false
zcat < ~/mimic/icu/chartevents.csv.gz | head
zcat < ~/mimic/icu/d_items.csv.gz | head
```

\(2\) decompressing the `chartevents.csv.gz` by `gzip`.

```{r}
#| eval: false
system("gzip -d -k ~/mimic/icu/chartevents.csv.gz")
```

\(3\) prepare the data for the plot.

Read the `d_items.csv.gz` and `chartevents.csv.gz` by `read_csv` and `filter` the patient with `subject_id` 10013310. Combine the two tables by `left_join`. Then, read the `chartevents.csv.gz` and filter the patient with `subject_id` 10013310. Combine the two tables by `left_join`.

```{r}
#| eval: true
# read the d_items.csv.gz
items <- read_csv("~/mimic/icu/d_items.csv.gz") %>%
  dplyr::select(c(itemid, label, abbreviation)) %>%
  dplyr::filter(abbreviation %in% c("HR", "NBPd", "NBPs", "RR", "Temperature F"))

# define the file path of chartevents.csv
file_path_chartevents <- "~/mimic/icu/chartevents.csv"

# read the chartevents.csv.gz
chartevents <- arrow::open_dataset(file_path_chartevents, format = "csv") %>%
  dplyr::filter(itemid %in% c(220045, 220179, 220180, 220210, 223761)) %>%
  dplyr::filter(subject_id == 10013310) %>%
  dplyr::select(-c(hadm_id, caregiver_id, storetime, warning)) %>%
  collect() %>%
  left_join(items, by = c("itemid" = "itemid"))
```

\(4\) plot the data.

```{r}
#| eval: true
vitals_line_plot <- ggplot(chartevents, 
                           aes(x = charttime, 
                               y = valuenum, 
                               color = abbreviation)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  # use facet_grid to show all combinations of abbreviation and stay_id
  facet_grid(abbreviation ~ stay_id, scales = "free") +
  labs(title = paste("Patient", 
                     chartevents$subject_id[1], 
                     "ICU stays - Vitals"),
       x = "",
       y = "") +
  # set the theme
  theme_light(base_size = 9) +
  # remove legend
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  # to avoid overlapping of the x-axis labels, using guides with n.dodge = 2
  guides(x = guide_axis(n.dodge = 2)) 

print(vitals_line_plot)
```

## Q2. ICU stays

`icustays.csv.gz` (<https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/icu/icustays/>) contains data about Intensive Care Units (ICU) stays. The first 10 lines are

```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/icu/icustays.csv.gz | head
```

### Q2.1 Ingestion

Import `icustays.csv.gz` as a tibble `icustays_tble`.

**Answer**
Import `icustays.csv.gz` as a tibble `icustays_tble`.
```{r}
#| eval: true
icustays_tble <- arrow::open_dataset("~/mimic/icu/icustays.csv.gz", format = "csv") %>%
  collect()
```

### Q2.2 Summary and visualization

How many unique `subject_id`? Can a `subject_id` have multiple ICU stays? Summarize the number of ICU stays per `subject_id` by graphs.

**Answer**
By counting the number of unique `subject_id`, I can find that there are 50920 unique `subject_id`.
```{r}
#| eval: true
# calculate the number of unique subject_id
icustays_tble %>%
  dplyr::distinct(subject_id) %>%
  dplyr::count()
```
Check if a subject_id can have multiple ICU stays. By grouping the data by `subject_id` and counting the number of unique `stay_id`, I can find that a `subject_id` can have multiple ICU stays.
```{r}
#| eval: true
icustays_tble %>%
  dplyr::distinct(stay_id) %>%
  dplyr::count()

# Check if a subject_id can have multiple ICU stays
icustays_tble %>%
  dplyr::group_by(subject_id) %>%
  summarise(num_icu_stays = n_distinct(stay_id)) %>%
  dplyr::filter(num_icu_stays > 1)

```
Summarize the number of ICU stays per `subject_id` by graphs.
```{r}
#| eval: true
icustays_tble %>%
  group_by(subject_id) %>%
  summarise(num_icu_stays = n_distinct(stay_id)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = num_icu_stays)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of ICU Stays per Subject",
       x = "Number of ICU Stays per `subject_id`",
       y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()
```
## Q3. `admissions` data

Information of the patients admitted into hospital is available in `admissions.csv.gz`. See <https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/hosp/admissions/> for details of each field in this file. The first 10 lines are

```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/admissions.csv.gz | head
```

### Q3.1 Ingestion

Import `admissions.csv.gz` as a tibble `admissions_tble`.

### Q3.2 Summary and visualization

Summarize the following information by graphics and explain any patterns you see.

-   number of admissions per patient\
-   admission hour (anything unusual?)\
-   admission minute (anything unusual?)\
-   length of hospital stay (from admission to discharge) (anything unusual?)

According to the [MIMIC-IV documentation](https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/about/concepts/#date-shifting),

> All dates in the database have been shifted to protect patient confidentiality. Dates will be internally consistent for the same patient, but randomly distributed in the future. Dates of birth which occur in the present time are not true dates of birth. Furthermore, dates of birth which occur before the year 1900 occur if the patient is older than 89. In these cases, the patient's age at their first admission has been fixed to 300.

## Q4. `patients` data

Patient information is available in `patients.csv.gz`. See <https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/hosp/patients/> for details of each field in this file. The first 10 lines are

```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/patients.csv.gz | head
```

### Q4.1 Ingestion

Import `patients.csv.gz` (<https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/hosp/patients/>) as a tibble `patients_tble`.

### Q4.2 Summary and visualization

Summarize variables `gender` and `anchor_age` by graphics, and explain any patterns you see.

## Q5. Lab results

`labevents.csv.gz` (<https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/hosp/labevents/>) contains all laboratory measurements for patients. The first 10 lines are

```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/labevents.csv.gz | head
```

`d_labitems.csv.gz` (<https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/hosp/d_labitems/>) is the dictionary of lab measurements.

```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/d_labitems.csv.gz | head
```

We are interested in the lab measurements of creatinine (50912), potassium (50971), sodium (50983), chloride (50902), bicarbonate (50882), hematocrit (51221), white blood cell count (51301), and glucose (50931). Retrieve a subset of `labevents.csv.gz` that only containing these items for the patients in `icustays_tble`. Further restrict to the last available measurement (by `storetime`) before the ICU stay. The final `labevents_tble` should have one row per ICU stay and columns for each lab measurement.

![](labevents_tble.png)

Hint: Use the Parquet format you generated in Homework 2. For reproducibility, make `labevents_pq` folder available at the current working directory `hw3`, for example, by a symbolic link.

  #             starts_with("50931") ~ "glucose") 
  #print(width = Inf)
}
```




## Q6. Vitals from charted events

`chartevents.csv.gz` (<https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/icu/chartevents/>) contains all the charted data available for a patient. During their ICU stay, the primary repository of a patient's information is their electronic chart. The `itemid` variable indicates a single measurement type in the database. The `value` variable is the value measured for `itemid`. The first 10 lines of `chartevents.csv.gz` are

```{bash}

`d_items.csv.gz` (<https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/icu/d_items/>) is the dictionary for the `itemid` in `chartevents.csv.gz`.

```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/icu/d_items.csv.gz | head
```

We are interested in the vitals for ICU patients: heart rate (220045), systolic non-invasive blood pressure (220179), diastolic non-invasive blood pressure (220180), body temperature in Fahrenheit (223761), and respiratory rate (220210). Retrieve a subset of `chartevents.csv.gz` only containing these items for the patients in `icustays_tble`. Further restrict to the first vital measurement within the ICU stay. The final `chartevents_tble` should have one row per ICU stay and columns for each vital measurement.

Hint: Use the Parquet format you generated in Homework 2. For reproducibility, make `chartevents_pq` folder available at the current working directory, for example, by a symbolic link.

## Q7. Putting things together

Let us create a tibble `mimic_icu_cohort` for all ICU stays, where rows are all ICU stays of adults (age at `intime` \>= 18) and columns contain at least following variables

-   all variables in `icustays_tble`\
-   all variables in `admissions_tble`\
-   all variables in `patients_tble`
-   the last lab measurements before the ICU stay in `labevents_tble`
-   the first vital measurements during the ICU stay in `chartevents_tble`

The final `mimic_icu_cohort` should have one row per ICU stay and columns for each variable.

## Q8. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Summarize the following information about the ICU stay cohort `mimic_icu_cohort` using appropriate numerics or graphs:

-   Length of ICU stay `los` vs demographic variables (race, insurance, marital_status, gender, age at intime)

-   Length of ICU stay `los` vs the last available lab measurements before ICU stay

-   Length of ICU stay `los` vs the first vital measurements within the ICU stay

-   Length of ICU stay `los` vs first ICU unit
